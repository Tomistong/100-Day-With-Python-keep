Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

age = input("What is your current age?")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
age = int(age)
month = (90*12) - (age*12)
week = (90*52) - (age*52)
day = (90*365) - (age*365)

print(f"You have {day} days, {week} weeks, and {month} months left.")
